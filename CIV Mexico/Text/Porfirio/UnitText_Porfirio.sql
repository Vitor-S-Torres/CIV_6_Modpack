		"Rurales is a Mexican term used to describe two different government forces.  As originally constituted under Juárez the Rurales lacked the numbers and organization to effectively control the banditry widespread in Mexico during the 1860s and 1870s.  Following his accession to power in 1877, President Porfirio Díaz expanded the Rurales to nearly 2,000 by 1889 as part of his programme of modernization and repression.  Initially some captured bandits were forcibly inducted into the Rurales, as had been the case under Juárez.  The Rurales were heavily armed; carrying cavalry sabers, Remington carbines, lassos and pistols.  The Porfirian regime deliberately fostered the image of the Rurales as a ruthless and efficient organization which - under the notorious ley fuga - seldom took prisoners and which inevitably got its man.  Never numbering more than about 4,000 men and located in small detachments, the Rurales were too thinly spread to ever completely eliminate unrest in the Mexican countryside.");

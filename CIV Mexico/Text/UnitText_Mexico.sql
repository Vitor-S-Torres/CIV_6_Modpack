		"The caste system of New Spain forbade the riding of horses by Indigenous peoples (with some exceptions). However, the cattle-rearing prolific to the Mexican Plateau and elsewhere in what would become Mexico required the use of horses and horseback riding, and often those who were employed were mestizo and occasionally Indians. The solution? The saddles had to be different from those used in the military, and to further differentiate between military members and ranch workers, they had to wear leather clothing. This gave rise to the Cuerudo, literally meaning ‘leathered one’."),

		"LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_LEU_CHINACO_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2",					
		"Chinacos became very popular employees for wealthy plantation owners and ranchers, as they had a pedigree of fending off marauders and bandits from haciendas. During the Mexican War of Independence, these Chinacos (also called ‘Charros,’ a far broader term of horseman) became important soldiers on both sides of the war, lionized for the elite horsemanship and courage despite their lack of discipline. Their image transformed, they saw service from the 17th to the 19th centuries, during the Mexican War of Independence, the War of Reform, Second Franco-Mexican War, and the Mexican Revolution. Even during the Second World War, an army of 150,000 Charros was created in anticipation of a Nazi Invasion of Mexico. "),

		"The image of the brave and manly Chinaco defending the homeland became deeply ingrained in Mexican culture as a result. During the early twentieth century, this image of the Cuerudo, or Charro, outfit was based on a distinctive ‘charro suit,’ with a heavily embroidered leather jacket and set of tightly-cut leather trousers (or an ankle-length dress for women), complete with a sombrero. These brightly colored outfits would feature floral and occasionally Aztec motifs in embroidery, traditionally made of metallic thread. This depiction became popular with the rise of the Mariachi and the motion picture. This outfit also became a political costume used by Emiliano Zapata and Porfirio Diaz, to channel the look of the brave Chinaco, defending Mexico.");

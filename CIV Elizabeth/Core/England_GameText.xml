			<Text>A dreadnought is a type of battleship built during the early 20th century. First engineered by the British Royal Navy in 1906, the dreadnought was such a revolutionary design in its power that it became a key symbol in the race for naval superiority. Because of this, however, the dreadnought was quickly outclassed by the "super-dreadnought" and only ever saw combat in one battle: the Battle of Jutland between Britain and Germany, which ended in a stalemate.</Text>

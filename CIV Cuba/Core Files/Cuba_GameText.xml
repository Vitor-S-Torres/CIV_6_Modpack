			<Text>The first known human inhabitants of Cuba arrived in roughly 3,100 BC. The island saw its population grow in roughly 2,000 BC, with notable settlements on both the mainland and surrounding islands. The most prominent of these were the Cayo Redondo and Guayabo Blanco cultures in western Cuba. These cultures were later succeeded by the Guanajatabey for several centuries until the Taino and Ciboney peoples began migrating to the mainland, pushing the Guanajatabey westward. These two peoples, who were of Arawak descent, became the primary inhabitants of the island...but it would not last.</Text>

			<Text>In the year 1492, Christopher Columbus lead a Spanish expedition across the Atlantic Ocean to prove that it was faster to reach India via sailing west, rather than east. Instead, he ended up landing in the Bahamas (though he mistakenly believed he had indeed reached India). He would later travel south to Cuba, landing in what is now Guantanamo Bay, and began to assert dominance over the natives. Most were enslaved or subjugated, while others were killed attempting to repel the invaders. This would be among the first in a series of colonial crimes committed by the Spanish, as well as European powers in general.</Text>

			<Text>By the 16th century, Cuba was completely under Spanish control. In spite of numerous raids and pirate attacks, the colony was one of Spain's foremost in the New World, serving as a major economic hub for trade and shipment to the Old World. However, with the successes of the American, French, and Haitian Revolutions, Cubans soon became enthralled with the idea of independence. With the shakeup of the Spanish monarchy in the Iberian Peninsular War, independence efforts started with Creole aristocrats, and, though unsuccessful, continued on throughout the 19th century. Finally, in 1895, writer Jose Marti organized an uprising that begun the Cuban War for Independence against a dying Spanish empire. Though Marti himself was killed, the rebels led a largely successful campaign that, coupled with the entry of the United States to the war in 1898 against the Spanish, was enough to secure victory and independence.</Text>

			<Text>The result, however, was not entirely favourable for the Cuban people. The United States gained temporary control of the island after the war, and released it on conditions agreed upon under the Platt Amendment, which heavily restricted Cuba's sovereignty and gave American businesses special ownership of countless pieces of Cuban territory. For the next few decades, conditions continued to worsen for Cuban inhabitants, while corruption grew. This peaked during the years of Fulgencia Batista's rule, which established a strict authoritarian state on the island. In response, lawyer and athlete Fidel Castro organized the 26th of July Movement, an armed insurrection agains the Batista regime. Though his efforts failed now and then, Castro persisted and utilized both geography and allies as best as possible. Ultimately, the war came out in Castro's favour, with Batista fleeing to Spain and Castro's forces taking control over the island. Cuba would finally be truly independent.</Text>

			<Text>From there, Cuba has had several ups and downs. Castro, following the tenets of Marxist-Leninist vanguardism, largely implemented single-party rule (though elections are, surprisingly, present and grassroots-based). In response to the threat of a communist-led state just 90 miles away, the United States organized the Bay of Pigs invasion (which failed miserably) and began a huge embargo that lasts to this very day. After a brief period of tension with the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuba has begun focusing less on internal affairs and more on internationalism and broad support for third world countries all across the globe, particularly those in Latin America and Africa. Today, she is a world leader in volunteer efforts, medicinal development, humanitarian aid, and social development in both Latin America and abroad. Viva Cuba!</Text>

			<Text>Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz (1926 - 2016) was born to a rural farmer in the small town of Biran, Oriente (an eastern province of Cuba). His father had previously immigrated to Cuba from Spain, and had started running a relatively successful farm. Fidel himself was just one of seven siblings, quite a few of which would become heavily involved in the Cuban Revolution (particularly Ramon and Raul). At the age of six, Fidel was sent to his first school, and would continue going to various places of education for the duration of his childhood and adolescence.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SC_CASTRO_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2" Language="en_US">
			<Text>In 1945, Castro began studying law at the University of Harvard. It was during this time that Castro became intimately involved with politics, particularly in public speeches, demonstrations, and student activism. Castro soon became acquainted with Marxist theory, and in time began slowly developing a rebellious nature. The ascendency and dictatorship of Fulgencia Batista was ultimately the straw that broke the camel's back, and in 1953, Castro and several others led a raid on a military barracks, beginning what's now known as the Cuban Revolution.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SC_CASTRO_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Initially, Castro's first rebellion failed, and he was captured. During a speech to the courts, however, Castro declared the famous words: "history will absolve me". He ended up being released from prison as a political prisoner, and would travel to Mexico with his brother Raul in exile. It was here that Fidel met Ernesto "Che" Guevara, an Argentinian Marxist who was so swayed by the Cuban cause that he joined their revolution. Together, the revolutionaries returned to Cuba and continued their guerrila struggles. At times, the revolution suffered greatly; there was even one point when Castro had only 12 men on his side. But eventually, the tide began to turn as the revolutionaries fought from the mountains and inflammed the grievances of the Cuban peoples, who had suffered great injustices - poverty, racism, authoritarianism, exploitation - from the Batista regime and its foreign and corporate backers. Eventually, the revolution surged in popularity, size, and fervor to the point where, on January 1st, 1959, Batista himself fled to Spain. The revolutionaries had won.</Text>

			<Text>As the new prime minister of Cuba - a position that would later be replaced with a presidency - Castro set to work reorganizing and building up his homeland. One of the most noteworthy of his initial reforms was the Literacy Campaign, which in just two years(!) time increased the abysmal 60% literacy rate to 96% (for comparison, the United States' literacy rate today is 86%). While Cuba saw these major social and educational reforms, Castro also set to work implementing the tenets of his Marxist ideology, in particular his Marxist-Leninist beliefs (the need for a vanguard party to guide a workers' state for the transition to communism). The Communist Party of Cuba, established in 1965, became the ruling party of Cuba, with elections organized less around candidates of differing party stances and more between candidates of differing personal stances fighting for party candidacy.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SC_CASTRO_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Most important of all was Castro's land reforms. The United States, as per her part in the Spanish-American War, owned quite a few acres of land through government and business ownership (as per the Platt Amendment). As such, many Cubans - rich or poor - found that they couldn't lay claim to part of their own country! This, along with the ideological necessity of nationalizing land and business, led Castro to immediately begin mass seizures of land to be redistributed back to the Cuban people. Furious at this move - as well as having to live with a communist-led state right on their doorstep - the United States organized mercenaries to send to Cuba in what has since been called the Bay of Pigs invasion. It failed almost immediately, furthering the divide between Cuba and the United States and straining relations terribly.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SC_CASTRO_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6" Language="en_US">
			<Text>This would not be the last clash between the United States and Cuba, however. In 1962, American spy planes discovered Soviet-built nuclear missiles on Cuban soil, which triggered a 13-day crisis as tensions mounted between the United States, the Soviet Union, and Cuba in what has since been called the Cuban Missile Crisis. In order to prevent a large-scale nuclear war, the Soviet Union and the United States ultimately agreed to withdraw their nuclear stockpiles in Cuba and Turkey, respectively. This event permanently tarnished Castro's reputation, not only in his acceptance of having nuclear weapons on the island but his brash willingness to use them (a stance he came to oppose later in his life).</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SC_CASTRO_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_7" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Castro continued to win elections as prime minister and president of Cuba. For the duration of his tenure, Castro continued to work on reforms and development for his homeland. More striking, however, was his dedication to the cause of internationalism. As President, Castro oversaw several different efforts to send humanitarian and military aid to countless nations across Latin America and Africa in their efforts to achieve independence. Perhaps the best example of this was Cuba's role in the Angolan-South African War, where Apartheid-dominated South Africa waged war on Angola. It was here that Cuba intervened and not only assisted the Angolans in their own internal efforts, but severely weakened South Africa in the process, and in turn purposely weakened apartheid (which had begun to lose its grip on power). It is for this reason that Castro is widely recognized as a hero to many black South Africans, and was considered a personal close friend by Nelson Mandela.</Text>

			<Text>Though he came from an island of excellent medicines and a family of enduring physicality, Fidel could not live forever. In 2008, Castro suffered a heart attack in office; though he survived, he chose to resign over his health concerns. Even so, he continued to serve as a major member of the communist party, and wrote and spoke extensively in his last few years. He even continued serving as a statesman of sorts (he even met with Pope Francis I just a year before his death!), though he was more inclined to stick with books and newspaper articles. Finally, on November 26th, 2016, Fidel Castro passed away. He was 90 years old.</Text>

Fighting against the dictatorship of Batista, reorganizing Cuba, transforming his homeland into a medical and internationalist powerhouse - he accomplished many things. Perhaps - from an American perspective at least - his life is surrounded by controversy. But one thing is for certain - he carried within him a great ferver, an unyielding revolutionary spirit that never faltered, even until the end.</Text>
